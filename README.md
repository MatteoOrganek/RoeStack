##### RoeStack
A web app for Computing students to help each other with projects, connecting people with the same or similar modules via Reddit-like communities, all while finding useful student contacts (such as student or programme representatives and mentors through RoeBuddies). The main objective for this project focuses on aiding students and all the university staff by sharing guidance (while avoiding academic misconduct) and explaining difficult or interesting topics.


#### Setup

Below you can find the step-by-step procedure for installing and running a local dockerized web server for the webapp.

### Set-up the web application:

* Make sure that you don't have any other containers running using docker
* run ```docker-compose up --build```

#### Visit phphmyadmin at:

http://localhost:8081/

#### Visit your express app at:

http://localhost:3000

To be able to run the app, you will need to install the following:

* node.js  (windows: https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* docker desktop (for windows, this will also prompt you to install linux subsystem for windows https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/ )
